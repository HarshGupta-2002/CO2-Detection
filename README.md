# CO2-Detection
Measuring CO2 Concentration in Air using Arduino and MQ-135 Sensor

The project is an implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) Based Air Pollution Monitoring System Using Arduino.
The proposed framework unit incorporates an Arduino, MQ135 Gas sensor, LCD and ESP8266 Wi-Fi Device. Almost all the past and recent works in IoT are based on methods that implement these steps sequentially and independently.

## Hardware Requirements
-> Arduino Uno

-> Gas sensor MQ135

-> ESP8266 Wi-Fi Device

-> 16x2 LCD

-> Buzzer

->0.5m Arduino A-B Cable

## Execution
After execution of the code, a “hex” format file is formed. The location of it is to be copied and pasted in the program files of the arduino component of the simulation.
